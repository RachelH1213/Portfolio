  <h1>About “Who’s In Your Chosen Family?”</h1>

  <p>
    This playful identity reflection quiz was made for the LGBTQ+ community to explore the joy, humor, and heart behind chosen family. 
    Based on your answers, you were matched with a fictional queer family built around your vibe, values, and softness.
  </p>

  <p>
    Whether you found yourself in the Cozy Cottage Crew or the Glitter Squad, we hope this made you smile — and reminded you that queer kinship is beautiful, flexible, and real.
  </p>

  <p>
    Designed with love by a fellow queer student, inspired by late-night convos, queer memes, chosen siblings, and the resilience of our community.
