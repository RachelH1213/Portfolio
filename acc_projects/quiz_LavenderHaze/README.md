# Who's In Your Chosen Family?

## üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà About the Project

*Who‚Äôs In Your Chosen Family?* is a playful identity reflection quiz created for the LGBTQ+ community. Rooted in the concept of ‚Äúchosen family,‚Äù the project celebrates queer joy, kinship, and the unique support systems LGBTQ+ individuals often create for themselves.

The quiz invites users to answer 8 personality-based questions. Based on their answers, they‚Äôre matched with a fictional chosen family made up of queer archetypes‚Äîlike a trans dad who bakes bread, a goth nonbinary sibling, or a chaotic drag auntie.

This tool is intended to bring laughter, affirmation, and reflection to LGBTQ+ people in a soft and supportive way.

## Purpose

This quiz is a joyful digital space where LGBTQ+ folks can see their personalities reflected in affirming, fun, and fictional ‚Äúfamily‚Äù matches. It offers a moment of lightness and connection, especially for those who may not feel affirmed by traditional family systems.

## Design Process

1. **Concept Ideation**: I wanted to create something light-hearted but meaningful for the queer community, inspired by Buzzfeed-style quizzes and conversations about chosen family.
2. **Sketching Questions & Results**: I wrote questions that reflect queer humor, emotional needs, and daily vibes. I created fictional family profiles to match user personalities.
3. **White-box Prototyping**: I set up the HTML/CSS/JS structure with simple button-based interaction, using LocalStorage to track responses.
4. **Result Matching Logic**: Each answer stores a value in LocalStorage and the result page retrieves it to create a message.

## Challenges Faced

- Designing questions that were fun but not stereotypical
- Keeping logic manageable without libraries (pure JavaScript)
- Making results feel dynamic and personal with limited inputs
- Making sure the site structure followed the four-page minimum

## Next Steps

- Add more questions and more diverse result combinations
- Expand from one-result logic to score-matching or point system
- Improve visual design with queer-inspired aesthetics
- Add animations or sound to enhance personality
- Ensure mobile responsiveness and accessibility (alt text, tab nav, etc.)
- Collect more user feedback and iterate!
