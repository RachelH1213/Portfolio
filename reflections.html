        <h2>What I've Learned</h2>
        <p>
            In this class, I have gained a deeper understanding of computational thinking and its applications
            in creative fields. From working on interactive sketches with p5.js to building projects like
            autobiographical games and optical illusions, I've developed both technical and artistic skills.
        </p>
        <p>
            One of the key takeaways for me is the importance of iteration and experimentation. By creating
            and refining various projects, I've learned how to prototype ideas and evaluate their impact.
        </p>
        <p>
            Additionally, I’ve gained confidence in using tools like GitHub Pages for deployment, which will
            be invaluable in future collaborative and personal projects.
        </p>
        <h2>Future Goals</h2>
        <p>
            Moving forward, I want to explore more advanced creative coding topics, such as generative art
            and machine learning applications in design. This class has shown me how powerful computational
            tools can be in expanding the boundaries of creativity.
