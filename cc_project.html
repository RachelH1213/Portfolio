            The game represents the stages of life the player navigates through key phases: childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood. Each stage has unique challenges, which encouraging the player to collect growth items that represent important life values and experiences. Childhood: collects items symbolizing curiosity and learning. Adolescence: gathers empathy and self-reflection items. Young Adulthood: collects items representing independence and maturity. ssignment Reflection: Working on “Finding Self” allowed me to translate aspects of my own life journey into a game format. The most challenging part was figuring out how to visually represent each life stage in a way that felt meaningful yet simple for gameplay. Deciding on symbolic items for each stage helped convey the essence of growth without needing complex mechanics. Coding the game taught me a lot about scene transitions, user interaction, and visual effects in p5.js. the Self-Reflection Meter fill up as Rachel collected items gave me a sense of achievement, similar to the feeling of real-life growth. This project helps me understand how games can be a medium for self-expression that transform personal reflections into interactive experiences for others to explore.

                My partner described a silver cross-looklike earring with a jade green stone in the center. I magined it as two rectangles for the cross and a green circle for the stone. In the code, I used p5.js to draw that, with silver for the cross and green for the stone. I also tried the blendMode() to make the colors look cool.I experimented with blendmode like multiply, overlay. And I decided to use screen to make a spiritual thing behind the earring to stress on the emotion and memories on that earring. Some parts of the description were not very clear and overly simple, so I added some details like hightlights to refine it.

            <div class="project-description">
                For this assignment, I started by sketching two faces at its maximum size and one at its minimum size. This helped me figure out how different features, like the eyes and mouth, would look at different scales. Next, I translated those sketches into code using p5.js. I made the size of the face change based on where the mouse is (mouseX), the eyes adjust with the mouse as well, and I used random() to create different mouth shapes each time. I also added a function so that every time I mouse the mouse, a different face is generated。 Through this process, I learned that even small changes in parameters can make a big difference in how the face looks. For example, big eyes with a small mouth make the face look cute, while small eyes and a wide mouth look more funny. The cool thing was learning how I could use code to generate endless variations of the same basic form, making every face unique but still recognizable as part of the same style.

                This clock tracks the passage of time through the growth of a plant, from a seedling in the morning to a fully grown plant by the end of the day. It visualizes time as a natural process rather than a regimented sequence of seconds and minutes. Initially, I explored ideas like tracking time through emotions and body rhythms. I chose the plant growth clock because it emphasizes the organic passage of time. I tested different growth rates and used millis() to map time progression.

            <div class="project-description">
                I researched different optical illusions and focused on using rotating shapes to create a hypnotic effect. I started with simple circles and added squares, color transitions, and dynamic line thickness to make the illusion more interesting. After several tweaks, I found the right balance for a smooth, engaging animation. This illusion could be used as a cool loading animation for websites or even as a dynamic display on smartwatches, adding visual appeal without being too distracting.

                For this assignment, I tracked how often I played or changed songs over 7 days. Each bar in the data portrait shows one day, and the height of the bar shows how many times I changed songs. Each bar represents one day. The taller the bar, the more times I changed or played songs that day. If you hover over a bar, it will change color and show more details about that day. Tracking my music habits made me realize how often I change songs, especially when I’m working. Turning this data into a visual helped me see patterns I didn’t notice before. This was a fun way to learn more about my habits.
